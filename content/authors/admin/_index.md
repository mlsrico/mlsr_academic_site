Hi! I'm Marina Sánchez-Rico, and I'm a biostatistician and researcher in the Corentin 
Celton hospital, for the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). I'm a psychologist 
in formation, and I specialized in healthcare research, particularly in methodology 
and applied statistics. I am the main statistician in my research team, and I have 
recently obtained my PhD through my thesis [Diagnosis and Prognosis in Clinical Databases through Unsupervised Statistical Techniques](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PhvtspBP9C6e8U6zA01eIuvU74g5_RwI/view?usp=sharing) from Complutense University of Madrid.
